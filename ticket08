# Create a class that captures airline tickets. 
# Each ticket lists the departure and arrival cities, a flight number, and a seat assignment. 
# A seat assignment has both a row and a letter for the seat within the row (such as 12F). 

# main method:
# Make two examples of tickets being sold to passengers.
# display tickets booked details
